## Basic Setup:
- Use Cesium ION Token: "Add your ION token here"
- Load the 3D model with Asset ID: "Add your ION asset ID here"
- Enable Cesium World Terrain with shadows and realistic lighting
- Initial camera view should be on the asset 
- Initialize the terrain with:

```javascript
// Initialize Viewer with Cesium World Terrain
const viewer = new Cesium.Viewer('cesiumContainer', {
  terrain: Cesium.Terrain.fromWorldTerrain({
```

**IMPORTANT:** In Sandcastle, event handlers must be added with addEventListener (inline onclick does not work)

## Feature 1: Element Info Box
When clicking on a 3D element:
- Display all properties in an info box (top right)
- Important properties (categoryName, Family, Type, Level) should be highlighted
- The clicked element is marked in yellow
- The box can be closed with X

## Feature 2: Precise Date/Time Control for Shadow Simulation

**"Set Date/Time" Button:**
- Opens two input prompts sequentially
- First prompt: Date (Format: YYYY-MM-DD, e.g., 2024-07-15)
- Second prompt: Time in CET (Format: HH:MM, e.g., 14:30)
- Shadows are calculated for this exact time. Shadows affect terrain as well.
- Automatic handling of CET/CEST (summer/winter time)

**Dropdown menu with quick selection (keeps the current date):**
- Current Time
- Morning (08:00 CET)
- Noon (12:00 CET)
- Afternoon (15:00 CET)
- Evening (18:00 CET)

## Technical Requirements:
- Code must be completely in JavaScript (Sandcastle only accepts JS)
- HTML elements for panels must be created dynamically (e.g., as string with innerHTML)
- Robust error handling for property access
- Console.log for important actions (found categories, set time, etc.)
- Time conversion between CET and UTC (Cesium uses UTC internally)

## Example Workflow for Users:
1. Model loads automatically and is zoomed to
2. Click on element shows its properties
3. With "Set Date/Time" shadows can be simulated for any point in time (in CET)
